SWF/Search version 0.01
=======================

This module allows the searching of Macromedia SWF files for text
strings.  The supported methods of searching for text are currently
limited to strings within editable text fields, and frame labels.
Future versions will support strings created by font-shape based text,
and text used within actionscript expressions.

This initial release also does not support the compressed SWF files
created by Flash MX.
